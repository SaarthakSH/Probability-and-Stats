# How to access and execute RMD file

Installing and loading the necessary libraries and loading the associated data set are prerequisites for running the RMD R file. My recommendation is to make a folder to hold both the dataset and the RMD file when you download both, then inside that folder, make another folder called "DataSets" and put the excel file containing the data set inside of that. All of the work is done in a R Markdown file when you open the RMD file, and you must import the dataset in order to execute it. You can access the data set in the "DataSets" folder or any other name you like from the files tab. The route link for the imported data set must be copied after the data set has been imported since it must run with the installed libraries in order for the code to run. All codes should now run and function correctly after completing that. The codes can be knitted into PDF or HTML files, as desired.

# Different types of Hypotheses testing on Population

Performing population parameter hypothesis testing in R for samples with a sample size of more than 30 (z test) and fewer than 30 (t test). Using the chi square test to determine population variance. Taking out the null and alternative hypotheses and applying them to rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis depending on the confidence interval

## Skill used â€“ 

R, HTML, Hypothesis Testing, DT library was used.

## Output-

A report that is well-structured and objective that covers the population testing of several sorts of hypotheses. These population parameters' confidence intervals were calculated along with the null and alternate hypotheses, and the findings were discussed.
