# How to access and execute RMD file

Installing and loading the necessary libraries and loading the associated data set are prerequisites for running the RMD R file. My recommendation is to make a folder to hold both the dataset and the RMD file when you download both, then inside that folder, make another folder called "DataSets" and put the excel file containing the data set inside of that. All of the work is done in a R Markdown file when you open the RMD file, and you must import the dataset in order to execute it. You can access the data set in the "DataSets" folder or any other name you like from the files tab. The route link for the imported data set must be copied after the data set has been imported since it must run with the installed libraries in order for the code to run. All codes should now run and function correctly after completing that. The codes can be knitted into PDF or HTML files, as desired.

# Hourly wages of employee & Pet survey confidence interval

Using R, perform confidence interval testing on the employee's hourly salary for samples larger than 30 (z test) and smaller than 30. (t test). The upper and lower limits of the confidence intervals together with their mean value are shown using the density plot graphic. After that, all of the boxplots for the stores are displayed to allow for comparisons. Performing a confidence interval (z test) on a sample from a pet survey is done in the second section, after which the data set's visual is shown.

## Skill used â€“ 

R, HTML, Hypothesis Testing, Tidyverse, dplyr, knitr, RColorBrewer libraries were used

## Output-

A well-structured report with a goal about the hourly salaries of employees and the pet survey, along with recommendations based on the graphics. These samples and the survey were given a confidence interval, and the outcome was explained.
