Hypothesis testing and it's use in the gaming industry.
<B><FONT SIZE=3, COLOR="#0E4139"> 
<BR>
Hypothesis testing is a method for determining how reliably one can draw conclusions observed findings in a sample under study to the larger population from which the sample was drawn. It is used to assess the strength of evidence from the sample and provides a framework for making population-related decisions. The investigator develops a particular hypothesis, assesses data from the sample, and determines if the results support the hypothesis. (Statistics., 2021) 
<BR>
The translation of the study question into a null hypothesis, H0, and an alternative hypothesis, Ha is the first stage in testing hypotheses. The null and alternative hypotheses are short explanations of two potential versions of "truth" concerning the connection between the predictor of interest and the population result, generally in mathematical form. (Encyclopedia Britannica., 2020)
<BR>
Hypothesis testing is beneficial in a variety of industries, like finance and healthcare, but it can also be quite beneficial in the gaming business (which I am interested in). For example, we may do a hypothesis test to see how much an increase in the playerbase affects the game's gameplay, or if people are leaving gaming and there is a decrease, is it due to other games or is it due to our own game failing to meet the customer's expectations?.

Difference between z-test, t-test & F-test with their instances.
<BR> </FONT>
A z-test is used to compare the means of two populations, or to test the mean of a population vs a standard, using (n â‰¥ 30) samples whether or not the population standard deviation is known. It may also be used to compare the proportions of two populations or to compare the proportions of particular characteristics to a standard proportion. (B., 2019)
<BR>
Comparing the average technical wages of men and women & Comparing the proportion of defectives from two manufacturing lines, are some of the example.
<BR>
When the standard deviation of two populations is unknown and the sample size is small (n < 30), a t-test is used to compare the means of the two populations. A z-test may be used if you know the standard deviation of the populations. (B., 2019)
<BR>
Comparing the average weight of cars & Comparing the different types of phones based on the amount of RAM they offer, are some of the example. 
<BR>
The F-test is used to test the hypothesis that two population variances are equal, or that two or more population means are equal. (Industrial Statistics., 2019)
<BR>
Comparing the variability of bolt diameters from two machines & Comparing the variability of two manufacturing plants, are some of the example.

Importance of proper reference for Academic Integrity 
<BR> </FONT>
It is critical to provide error-free work as your project submission if you want to get excellent grades. However, writing fresh material in all of your projects, homework, and research work is difficult. As a result, students must gain the necessary expertise to ensure that their work is original and free of plagiarism. You must comprehend the necessity of referencing while writing academic research papers if you want your work to be legitimate. (Smith S., 2022)
<BR>
You must integrate numerous researchers' works in your work, particularly your research work, and you must refer to trustworthy sources for information such as articles, journals, research papers, or any book. Because writing specific stuff in your own words may result in inaccurate or misleading information. As a result, you must recognize the importance of referencing while writing your research papers. This article will provide you with thorough information on citations and referencing so that you can use them correctly. 
<BR>
<B> What's the point of a reference? </B>
<BR>
Correct referencing lets people to identify the sources you've used, which helps you prevent plagiarism by making it apparent which ideas are your own and which are someone else, displays your grasp of the issue provides supporting evidence for your ideas, arguments, and views (Library., 2022)

About the data set that is used in this project. 
<BR> </FONT>
The "MASS" library is used to pull the "cats" data set that is being used in this R Markdown project. The whole data set contains 144 rows and 3 columns. The first column is sexes of cat which has two types of variables: M for males & F for females. The second column is bwt which is the body weight of cats in kg. Finally, the last column is hwt which is the heart weight of cats in gm.

After taking out the basic descriptive stats(mean, SD, median, max value, min value, range & 25th quantile) of the "cats" data set for both the body weight and heart weight numeric variable for the data set, the table was represented by using the DT library and formatRound function was used to make the table more visually presentable by rounding off the values. We can analyze from the table that mean of both the variables are greater than the median indicating that the distribution graph will be positively skewed. Other than that, the range of heart weight is comparatively bigger than the range of body weight which indicates that there is huge variation in the heart weight variable when compared to body weight variable.

The male and female cats were separated from the total cats data set using a subset function. The null hypothesis was then tested using the right tail hypothesis testing (z-test) on the mean and SD of male and female cats body weight to see whether it could be rejected. We can see from the table that the mean and SD of male cats body weight are higher than those of female cats body weight. After determining the z-test value, the ztest was performed on the critical value (alpha = 0.01) where the ztest was more than the critical value (ztest > critical value = TRUE). To emphasize the case even better, a pvalue test was performed on the identical right tailed z test value, confirming that the p value result was smaller than the alpha value (pvalue < alpha = TRUE).

<B>CONCLUSION</B>
</FONT>
<B><FONT SIZE=3, COLOR="#0E4139"> 
<BR>
To emphasize a few points, for both the numeric columns body weight and heart weight of cats, the mean was bigger than the median, indicating that the distribution graph would be positively skewed. In addition, the heart weight range of cats was much bigger than the body weight range. The alpha values of 0.01 and 0.001 for the ztest and pvalue test for the cats body weight and heart weight (male and female cats) correspondingly confirmed that we would reject the null hypothesis for both the right tail test scenarios. The identical situation occurred during the variance difference test (ftest) for the cats body weight and heart weight (male and female cats) with alpha values of 0.01 and 0.001, respectively, confirming that the null hypothesis would be rejected in both right tail test scenarios. Finally, in the final task, where the alternative hypothesis was "Meditation enhances sleep quality" we were unable to reject the null hypothesis which confirmed that "Meditation doesn't enhance sleep quality".
<BR>
As a result, my advice after inferential testing is that the mean body weight/heart weight of male and female cats is not the same. Also, after concluding the study on 13 students, I would conclude that "Meditation does not increase sleep quality," and the researchers who came to that conclusion are incorrect. We will commit a type 1 mistake if we follow their advice since we will reject the right null hypothesis.
<BR>
Finally, I improved my understanding of hypothesis testing, z test, t test, and f test when comparing two samples. Not only that, but I also learnt about the subset function, which was comparable to the dplyr filter function and was used to filter distinct cat sex types. On a real-world example, I also learnt how to execute hypothesis testing for two dependent paired samples and how to compute the t distribution value.
