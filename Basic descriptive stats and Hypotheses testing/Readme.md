# How to access and execute RMD file

Installing and loading the necessary libraries and loading the associated data set are prerequisites for running the RMD R file. My recommendation is to make a folder to hold both the dataset and the RMD file when you download both, then inside that folder, make another folder called "DataSets" and put the excel file containing the data set inside of that. All of the work is done in a R Markdown file when you open the RMD file, and you must import the dataset in order to execute it. You can access the data set in the "DataSets" folder or any other name you like from the files tab. The route link for the imported data set must be copied after the data set has been imported since it must run with the installed libraries in order for the code to run. All codes should now run and function correctly after completing that. The codes can be knitted into PDF or HTML files, as desired.

# Basic descriptive stats and Hypotheses testing 

Using R to perform basic descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing on a survey that examines the impact of meditation on sleep quality and a data collection of cats from the MASS library. performing z and p tests for cats, t and p tests for the survey, and making recommendations in view of the discoveries.

## Skill used â€“ 

R, HTML, Hypothesis Testing, DT, MASS libraries was used.

## Output-

A report that is well-structured and objective, including basic descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing. The dataset for these cats as well as the findings of the meditation survey with their null and alternative hypotheses were used to calculate confidence intervals.
