# How to access and execute RMD file

Installing and loading the necessary libraries and loading the associated data set are prerequisites for running the RMD R file. My recommendation is to make a folder to hold both the dataset and the RMD file when you download both, then inside that folder, make another folder called "DataSets" and put the excel file containing the data set inside of that. All of the work is done in a R Markdown file when you open the RMD file, and you must import the dataset in order to execute it. You can access the data set in the "DataSets" folder or any other name you like from the files tab. The route link for the imported data set must be copied after the data set has been imported since it must run with the installed libraries in order for the code to run. All codes should now run and function correctly after completing that. The codes can be knitted into PDF or HTML files, as desired.

# Linear and Multiple Regression 

Using the mpg data set from the ggplot2 package and R tools like summarytool and psych to do basic descriptive statistics. After calculating the coefficient of correlation and determination for the data set, the desc tool library was used to present the basic statistical operations. A scatterplot illustrates the removal of linear regression between the dependent and independent variables. They were then shown their anticipated and residual values using the computed linear regression. A use case was ultimately evaluated using these values. Multiple regression analysis on the Patient data set was carried out. A use case was then detailed once a F test was completed. A scatterplot was ultimately employed to describe the outcomes.

## Skill used â€“ 

R, HTML, Hypothesis Testing, DT, knitr, ggplot2, summarytools, DescTools libraries was used.

## Output-

A report that is objective and well-organized, including both multiple and linear regression. For the linear regression analysis, many values were employed, and use examples were discussed. Data from the patient were subjected to multiple regression analysis.
